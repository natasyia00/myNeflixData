            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <img src="netflix image.png" alt="Netflix Logo" style="width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
            <p>The motivation behind this data analysis starts from my desire to gain deeper insights into my viewing patterns on Netflix spanning over the years 2020 to 2023.</p>
            <p>By examining and analyzing the data related to my watching habits, this analysis aims to uncover trends, preferences, and patterns in the content consumed. Understanding the distribution between TV shows and movies,
                identifying favorite genres, exploring the most-watched shows, and delving into the temporal aspects of viewing such as daily and monthly patterns, will provide valuable information.
                This exploration seeks to offer a comprehensive overview of my Netflix watching behavior, contributing to a better understanding of personal preferences and habits throughout this period.</p>

            <h2>Data Source</h2>
            <p>The data utilized for this analysis was obtained through 2 distinct sources.
                The 1st dataset was requested from Netflix, getting the access to my family's Netflix account. From the dataset that was sent by Netflix,
                I extracted my individual viewing profile data, ensuring a personalized and focused dataset for the analysis.</p>
                
            <p>The 2nd dataset was downloaded from a supplementary source was (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows">Kaggle</a>) which is a platform that hosts various datasets for public use. 
                The specific dataset used in this analysis, known as the "Netflix Dataset," was acquired from Kaggle.</p>

            <p>With these 2 datasets, I combined both of them together to get the final dataset where it provides a comprehensive perspective on my Netflix viewing habits, merging personalized account data with a broader dataset available through Kaggle for a more extensive analysis.</p>
